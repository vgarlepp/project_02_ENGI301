# Project 2, ENGI 301, Vanessa Garlepp
This project aims to create an example schematic and layout for an Etch-A-Sketch device. The folder also contains manufacturing files, a bill of materials, and a mechanical block diagram in the form of a Powerpoint. Further pictures of documentation are in the "docs" folder, and EAGLE files are within the EAGLE folder.
